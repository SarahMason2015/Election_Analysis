**<h1>Election Analysis</h1>**

<h2>Overview </h2>

<p> Tom has been enlisted in creating a more sophisticated way to tally votes using python. If he is successful, not only will his methods be used for his congressional precinct in Colorado, but also for Senatorial races as well as local elections. Tom must tally votes from three voting methods. Total count, percentages and more will establish which candidate is the winner.

<h2>Summary </h2>

<p> There are several factors in play when looking into elections. The information provided is the result of hard work, time, and money by candidates and their teams. After all the work that's put into an election, you want to win. What if you don't, and what other information can be gathered from this process? 
  
<p>We can easily see the winners and losers, but here are a few questions that weren't answered: 
  
  - How many people didnâ€™t vote? 
  
  - What is the breakdown for individual voting methods? 
  
  - How much did each candidate spend?
  
<p>Having this information could show candidates where they can focus to get more people to vote and potentially where more polling centers should be, how much money they need to raise.  This information can be added to the current script, all we need is the data. 

<p>Since this project appears to be a success, this script can easily be modified for many types of elections. Although some refactoring would be involved, the hard work done!
